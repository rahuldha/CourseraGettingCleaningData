# Course Projcet for Getting and Cleaning Data Course  
This repository contains files required for the final project of the course 
## Overview of the project  
The main script file for this project is run_analysis.R. The script file performs the following main tasks:  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
The tidy data set is written to a separate file called tidydata.txt.  
The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
